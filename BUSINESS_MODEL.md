# Business Model

## Revenue Goal

Repo Scout will become a paid local and CI policy tool for small software teams
that use coding agents heavily and need consistent repository handoffs and
guardrails without sending source code to a hosted service.

The immediate target is three paid founding-team pilots, producing $897 in
initial revenue before licensing or billing infrastructure is built.

## Ideal Customer

- Software teams with 5 to 50 developers.
- Teams using coding agents across multiple repositories.
- Engineering leads who own review quality, repository standards, or handoffs.
- Security-conscious teams that prefer local tooling over source-code uploads.

## Offer

### Free Core

- Local repository snapshots in text, JSON, and Markdown.
- Attention findings and CI-friendly exit codes.
- Saved snapshot comparison and bounded changed-path details.
- A copy-ready, read-only GitHub Actions policy gate with failure evidence.
- Offline starter policies for baseline, Python, npm, and agent-ready services.
- A no-install, single-file zipapp for the primary CLI.
- Versioned GitHub release artifacts with checksums and verifiable build provenance.

The free CLI should be good enough to adopt without a sales conversation.

Verified GitHub releases remove source-checkout trust and installation friction
from pilot onboarding. PyPI distribution, billing, and license enforcement stay
deferred until paid demand justifies their operational cost.

The copy-ready CI gate consumes those releases with independent digest and
provenance checks. This makes the free activation path closer to the paid pilot
deployment model: teams can evaluate a repeatable, auditable install before
buying cross-repository rollout support.

### Founding Team Pilot

Price: $299 for 90 days, covering up to 10 repositories.

The pilot includes:

- A shared, version-controlled repository policy.
- CI enforcement guidance and rollout support.
- One custom policy pack for the team's repository standards.
- First-repository readiness evidence and a reusable rollout checklist.
- Direct feedback access and priority fixes during the pilot.

The paid value is consistency across repositories and teams, not access to the
basic local scanner.

Rollout bundles carry a stable, non-sensitive metadata contract so a pilot lead
can summarize bundle-reported readiness, policy failures, violations, worktree
state, and attention across repositories without sending source code to Repo
Scout. Counts are private by default; repository details require explicit opt-in.
Normalized policy fingerprints let the operator verify that complete schema-2
bundles used identical enforced rules, while Git commit IDs identify the exact
revisions scanned. Neither field proves evidence age or authenticity, so paid
rollout support still includes controlled evidence handling and CI operations.
The copy-ready CI gate now produces one aggregatable rollout bundle on every
completed scan, including policy failures. This turns weekly CI use and
cross-repository policy reuse into evidence a pilot operator can review without
a Repo Scout-hosted database.

The hosted offer now leads with this cross-repository outcome: complete policy
and commit identity coverage, shared-policy verification, and visible
remediation work. Its example is labeled bundle-reported and the application
CTA repeats the $299 price, so purchase-readiness responses follow a concrete,
price-disclosed offer rather than a generic request for contact.

The first shared-policy release supports required files, repository file and
byte limits, and clean Git enforcement through a strict TOML file that can be
committed once and reused in CI.

## Conversion Path

1. A developer downloads the portable release and adopts the free CLI for handoffs or reviews.
2. The team initializes and commits the closest starter policy.
3. The team copies the GitHub Actions gate into its first repository.
4. The team records a passing rollout bundle and needs the same standard across repositories.
5. The engineering lead reviews the hosted offer and submits a qualified pilot request.
6. The engineering lead buys a pilot for shared policies and rollout support.

The current request form is a public GitHub issue and warns teams not to share
source code or sensitive details. A private intake channel is deferred until
pilot demand validates the additional infrastructure.

## Validation Milestones

- Sell three pilots before building billing or license enforcement.
- At least two pilot teams run Repo Scout in CI weekly.
- At least one pilot policy is reused across three repositories.
- At least one pilot converts to an annual team license.

## Revenue Evidence

Founding-team requests are tracked with cumulative `pilot-*` labels and the
dependency-free `repo-scout-pilot` report. Only issues that reach `pilot-paid`
or a later paid stage count toward the three-pilot and $897 initial-revenue
targets. Qualified leads and written offers remain pipeline, not booked
revenue. Label warnings must be resolved before totals are used in a roadmap or
sales decision.

Open lead, qualified, and offered issues inactive for seven UTC calendar days
appear in the funnel's follow-up list. This is an operating prompt based on
GitHub issue activity, not evidence that a buyer was or was not contacted.

The intake records one required, self-reported discovery channel. Funnel source
totals connect those channels to qualification, offers, booked revenue,
conversion, and loss. Missing or edited legacy answers remain explicit warning
buckets. This is directional acquisition evidence, not proof that a single
touchpoint caused a purchase.

The intake also requires one public purchase-readiness answer: ready to buy the
$299 pilot, needs internal approval, or exploring before requesting budget.
Funnel totals connect each readiness state to qualification, offers,
booked revenue, conversion, and loss. Readiness is self-reported intent, not
cash; only `pilot-paid` or a later paid stage counts as booked revenue.

The intake requires one primary purchase criterion covering policy fit,
cross-repository rollout, leadership or audit evidence, privacy and security,
implementation capacity, commercial fit, or other. Schema-6 funnel totals
connect that criterion to qualification, offers, payment, conversion, and loss.
This creates structured customer learning before outreach scales, but a stated
criterion is not a moat or proof of demand. Repeated paid outcomes must show
which policy packs, evidence patterns, and rollout playbooks are defensible.

Schema-6 reporting also turns every open pre-payment request into a prioritized
sales action. Ready buyers surface first, approval-dependent buyers receive an
approval-oriented action, exploratory buyers receive a proof or decision-criteria
action, and unclear answers require clarification. Funnel stage and issue age
order deals within those groups. The queue is an operating aid, not an automated
decision, and it neither sends outreach nor changes booked-revenue semantics.

## Product Filter

New work must improve acquisition, activation, conversion, or retention for the
paid team workflow. Generic features that do not strengthen that path stay out
of the near-term roadmap.

The 1,000-commit delivery goal does not weaken this filter. Commit count is a
measure of sustained execution; revenue evidence remains the measure of product
success.

Distribution work must reduce the path from discovery to a successful local
scan, team CI activation, or a qualified pilot request. Portable and wheel
downloads, repository traffic, and source attribution are distribution evidence;
they do not replace booked revenue. The supported channel contract and metrics
live in `DISTRIBUTION.md`.

The local `repo-scout-distribution` report audits public release completeness
and separates portable, wheel, source, checksum, and unknown artifact requests.
Those counts can include Repo Scout's own CI, maintainer checks, and retries, so
they are directional reach evidence only. They must be reviewed beside pilot
source and purchase-readiness reports rather than presented as users or sales.

Weekly schema-2 baselines turn cumulative release counters into signed channel
movement and flag evidence resets or removals. These deltas make distribution
experiments comparable over time, but they retain the same CI and maintainer
confounders and therefore remain directional until a buyer self-reports a source
or enters the paid funnel.

The dependency-free `repo-scout-growth` review places those signed deltas beside
schema-5 or schema-6 pilot source, qualification, offer, payment, and revenue totals. It
names one current commercial bottleneck and next action so weekly roadmap work
responds to the paid funnel instead of optimizing raw download counts. Input
warnings and missing or ambiguous source answers remain visible. Because release
requests are neither unique people nor attributable sessions, the review never
computes a download-to-lead conversion rate or assigns request movement to a
discovery source.
